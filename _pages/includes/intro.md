# **üë®‚Äçüéì About Me**
Hi! I am currently a **Graduate Research Assistant** at Operation Research and Optimization Lab, School of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, advised by [Prof. Weiming Shen](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=FuSHsx4AAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to this, I received my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from **Huazhong University of Science and Technology**, Wuhan, China, in 2022, and Bachelor's degree in Automotive Engineering from **Wuhan University of Technology**, Wuhan, China, in 2020.

My research interest broadly lies in the area of **Computational Optimization** and **Machine Learning** (e.g., deep reinforcement learning), and I believe these techniques can enable innovative applications in automotive, mobility, and robotics systems. However, I am also concerned about their limited real-world applicability in safety-critical autonomous driving systems, and I want to explore ways to bridge the simulation-to-reality gaps in my research.

I am looking for a Ph.D. position for Fall 2023 intake.
