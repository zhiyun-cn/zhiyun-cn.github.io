# üë®‚Äçüéì About Me
Hi! I am currently a graduate research assistant at the [School of Mechanical Science and Engineering](http://mse.hust.edu.cn), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Weiming Shen](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=FuSHsx4AAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to this, I received my **M.Sc.** degree in **Industrial Engineering** from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and **B.Eng.** degree in **Automotive Engineering** from Wuhan University of Technology.

My research interest broadly lies in optimization- and learning-based algorithms on **decision making** and **motion planning**, such as Evolutionary Computation (EC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), as well as their promising applications for the operation of future autonomous mobility systems enabled by **Connected and Automated Vehicles**.

I am looking for a **Ph.D.** position for **Fall 2023** intake. If there is a potential research opportunity in your lab, I would appreciate the change to communicate with you and provide more detailed information about my research.
