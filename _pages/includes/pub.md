[1] LiDAR-based End-to-End Autonomous Driving at Unsignalized Intersections: Improving Generalization with Multi-Task Deep Reinforcement Learning. **Zhiyun Deng**, Kaidi Yang, Weiming Shen and Yanjun Shi.

**To be Submitted** to IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (**IEEE TASE**).

- We employ deep RL to train a lidar-based end-to-end driving policy and enhanced its generalization ability with multi-task learning in a variety of traffic densities and road maps.
