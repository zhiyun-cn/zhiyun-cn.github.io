[1] [V2X-Lead: Lidar-based End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Vehicle-to-Everything Communication Integration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tjTFgA03NNesLT7uYZ_WptU_QNq03qu_/view?usp=share_link). **Zhiyun Deng**, Yanjun Shi, and Weiming Shen.

**IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems** (IROS), 2023.

- Utilized vehicle-to-everything communication to enhance the safety and efficiency of an end-to-end autonomous driving agent trained by a reinforcement learning algorithm, particularly when the agent's vision is obstructed by other vehicles in mixed-autonomy traffic.
